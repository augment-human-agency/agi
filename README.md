# AGI: Augment Human Agency

## Project Overview
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a forward-thinking initiative under the Augment Human Agency (AHA) framework, focused on building ethical, human-centered AI systems. The project emphasizes safe self-modification, adaptability, and the amplification of human potential through responsible AI governance and development.

## Mission
Our mission is to create AI systems that enhance human agency, promote fairness, and prioritize transparency and ethical standards. We believe in a future where AGI serves as a guide, collaborator, and partner in solving complex challenges and enabling a more equitable society.

## Core Components
### 1. **Safe Sage Module**
   - **Objective:** Provide ethical guidance to AI decision-making processes.
   - **Features:** Faith-driven decision engine, optimality frameworks, and alignment protocols.

### 2. **Augment Baby SDK**
   - **Objective:** Equip developers with tools to build adaptive AI agents.
   - **Features:** Modular design, dynamic memory, and support for cross-domain learning.

### 3. **Self-Modifying Architecture**
   - **Objective:** Enable AI to adjust and improve its own code within bounded ethical guidelines.
   - **Features:** Resource-aware computation, safety protocols, and adaptive agents.

## Guiding Principles
- **Transparency:** Clear documentation and communication of development milestones.
- **Fairness:** Avoiding bias and promoting inclusive AI practices.
- **Ethics:** Embedding human values and ethical considerations into AI behavior.
- **Community-Driven:** Open-source contributions and collaborative development.
