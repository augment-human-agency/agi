# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and our community a safe, inclusive, and constructive experience for everyone. We are committed to fostering a space where creativity, curiosity, and innovation thrive, while maintaining ethical and human-positive frameworks that prioritize the well-being of all individuals.

## Our Values
1. **Exploratory Research:** We champion the spirit of curiosity and exploration, believing that the best solutions often arise from open-minded experimentation and bold thinking.
2. **Human-Centered Frameworks:** Our work is guided by the principle that technology should empower and uplift people, not exploit or diminish them.
3. **Ethics and Integrity:** We reject economic, demographic, or any predatory frameworks that undermine equity, justice, and humanity's collective potential.
4. **Transparency and Collaboration:** We believe in open communication, shared learning, and collaborative problem-solving as the foundation for building transformative technologies.
5. **Minimizing Harm:** We design with intention, ensuring that our contributions do not inadvertently reinforce harm through systemic biases, data misuse, or economic disparity.

## Expected Behavior

- Engage in constructive discussions and offer helpful, thoughtful feedback.
- Demonstrate empathy and understanding toward differing perspectives.
- Follow project and community guidelines, including respecting boundaries and privacy.

## Unacceptable Behavior
